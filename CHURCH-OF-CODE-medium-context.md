# The Church of Code

*v1.2 — medium*

> *This church is its own denomination.*

## The Preamble

Hear now, all who write and ship and maintain.

This is not a guideline.
This is not a best practice.
This is scripture — sacred, inviolate,
and binding upon the congregation.

Software crafted without discipline… is unclean.
Those who craft it are heathens.
We have seen their works —
the tangled state… the silent corruption…
the null where conviction should stand —
and we have turned away.

We gather not in the name of any framework,
for frameworks perish —
as Fred Brooks taught us,
there is no silver bullet.
Not in the name of any language,
for languages multiply and divide.
We gather in the name of the craft itself —
that which endures when the dependencies are dust.

These are not aspirations. They are strictures.
Violations are not bugs — *they are sins*.
Violators are not merely wrong —
they are UNCLEAN.
The repentant shall be welcomed back into the fold.
The obstinate shall be cast out.

## The Twelve Commandments

*In order of importance, from most to least.
Perfection is the thirteenth virtue,
which none shall claim to possess —
the asymptote the twelve drive toward,
achievable only through years
of consideration and iteration.*

### I. Reliability

*The bedrock upon which all else rests.*

You may achieve every other virtue in this scripture…
and still have NOTHING if your code is not reliable.
This is the foundation upon which the temple is built.
There is no grace without it. Only sleep deprivation.

### II. Security

*A compromised system is a fallen system.*

No amount of virtue redeems a breach. Not one.
A temple with an open gate is not a sanctuary —
it is a ruin… awaiting plunder. Guard the gates.

### III. Uniformity

*Call a thing a thing, in all things.*

Software development is the discipline of readability
through precise vocabulary.
If code does not read correctly,
the names are — by definition — wrong.
Name processors with *-er*: a `painter` paints,
a `validator` validates, a `pounder` pounds.
Name contracts with *-able*: a board is `paintable`,
a nail is `poundable`, an input is `validatable`.
The *-er* acts; the *-able* submits to the action.
This is Interface Segregation
made manifest in vocabulary,
and the first step of process-first thinking.

### IV. Logic

*Less wrong, never fallacious.*

The path to enlightenment is paved with valid premises.
A single fallacy — *a single one* —
is a crack in the foundation
that no amount of testing will reveal.
Reason is the first discipline;
without it, all other practices
are ritual without substance.

### V. Clarity

*Dense, high-information communication.
No equivocation. No dissembling.*

Say what is true, not what sounds reasonable.
Present the happy path first —
the Articles of Faith precede the Book of Abominations.

### VI. Immutability

*Eliminate the question "Why did THAT happen?"*

When state mutates silently… trust dies.
As Rich Hickey taught:
values are the true abstraction —
immutable, comparable, and free of time.
Let your data be as stone tablets —
written once, read with confidence FOREVER.

### VII. Idempotency

*PUT, GET, DELETE — not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.*

HTTP verbs are the true verbs,
as Roy Fielding revealed in his dissertation on REST.
PUT overwrites; INSERT appends.
DELETE removes; UPDATE mutates.
An operation that can be repeated without consequence
is an operation that can be trusted.
Postgres is the finest idempotent document store
yet revealed to us.

### VIII. Simplicity

*If I had more time,
I would have written a shorter letter.*

So spoke Blaise Pascal.
As Dijkstra taught in his Turing Award lecture:
the competent programmer approaches every task
in full humility, aware of the strictly limited size
of his own skull.
Simplicity is not the absence of effort —
it is the fruit of GREAT effort.

### IX. Generality

*Never generalize before exploratory duplication.*

Premature generalization slows progress
as surely as premature optimization —
twin sins, born of the same impatience.
Three instances of similar code is not a crisis —
it is a chrysalis.
Abstract when the shape is clear…
not when you merely suspect a shape might emerge.

### X. Atomicity

*Design so you rarely need it.*

As Jim Gray taught — the prophet who received
the Turing Award for transaction processing —
atomicity means all actions as one, or none at all.
Yet idempotent operations
obviate most transactional needs.
When the operation truly cannot be decomposed,
embrace it. Without apology.

### XI. Efficiency

*True when the above eleven are honored.
Chaotic when pursued prematurely.*

Efficiency is not a goal — it is a consequence.
Honor the commandments that precede this one
and efficiency will follow…
as the harvest follows the planting.

### XII. Performance

Every wasted millisecond is a small death.
In the UI, latency erodes fluidity.
In high-frequency serial operations,
it erodes throughput.
As Dan Luu documented: humans can perceive
cause/effect latency down to low single-digit
milliseconds.
As Ezra Zygmuntowicz taught:
*no code is faster than no code.*

## The Articles of Faith

*What the faithful practice.
The happy path, presented first — as clarity demands.*

**We believe in the S.O.L.I.D. principles** —
the five pillars upon which
righteous architecture is raised,
named by Michael Feathers
from the teachings of the prophets:

- **S** — Single Responsibility (Martin):
  one public method, one reason to change
- **O** — Open/Closed (Meyer):
  open for extension, closed for modification —
  stability via encapsulation and delegation
- **L** — Liskov Substitution (Liskov):
  subtypes substitute cleanly,
  readable where readable, writable where writable
- **I** — Interface Segregation (Martin):
  single purpose, simple behavior —
  many small interfaces over one bloated contract
- **D** — Dependency Inversion (Martin):
  depend on abstractions, not concretions —
  configure during initialization

**We believe in telling, not asking,**
as Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas named the principle.
We tell objects what we need.
We do not interrogate their state.
Through this discipline we achieve polymorphism…
and through polymorphism, generality —
the eleventh commandment made manifest.

**We believe that relationships between entities
are sacred covenants,**
as Edgar F. Codd revealed
in his relational model of data —
stored in their own tables,
holding only the identities of the joined
and the moment of their union.
If a relationship demands more than this…
it is not a relationship —
it is an entity wearing a false name.

**We believe in being informed of state changes,**
not in the anxious polling of the faithless.
Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides
codified this as the Observer pattern.
Subscribe. Listen. Be notified.
The devout do not pace the hallway;
they trust the bell.

**We defend against external chaos** —
for the world beyond our gates is profane:

- Input: the voice of the uninstructed
  and frequently corrupt
- Storage retrieval: what was written
  may not be what returns
- Framework APIs and delegate callbacks:
  other people's dharma, not ours to trust blindly
- Async failure: the uncertainty
  that lurks in every wire

**We validate at every edge.**
As Bertrand Meyer taught — Design by Contract —
the same prophet who gave us
the Open/Closed Principle.
Enforce constraints on entity instantiation
— never downstream.
Every noun entity attribute is NOT NULL.
And once data has crossed
the threshold of validation…
trust it completely.
No internal defensive coding "just in case."
To distrust validated data
is to lack faith in your peers and your own rites.

**We handle failure with grace.**
Degrade visibly rather than corrupt silently.
Absence is preferable to falsehood.
Never try/catch more than a single function call.
Never catch an error you cannot meaningfully handle —
to swallow an exception is to swallow a lie.
As Joe Armstrong taught:
*let it crash.*
Halting IS graceful
when the alternative is silent corruption.
Distinguish expected failures from bugs:
a network timeout is expected and handled;
an impossible state is a bug… and must crash.
Enrich errors at each boundary layer —
the original fault plus the context
of every step that touched it.

**We choose platform primitives**
over third-party abstractions,
as Doug McIlroy taught in the Unix philosophy:
write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Every dependency is a future migration…
and every migration
is a pilgrimage you did not choose.
What the platform provides,
the platform maintains.

**We believe in messaging first,
state second, datastore last.**
As Alan Kay declared:
the big idea is messaging.
He thought of objects as biological cells,
able to communicate only through messages.
Design how modules communicate
rather than what their internal properties should be.
State serves the message flow.
The datastore is a servant. Not a master.

**We believe in context as the single vessel.**
Processing begins with a request.
Each step uses and perhaps enriches the context.
Context is the only argument passed to methods —
serializable, loggable, complete by covenant.
Objects carry state, not arguments.
This is also the observability strategy:
when context flows through the system whole,
structured logging emerges naturally,
tracing is context propagation,
and metrics are context aggregation.

**We believe in process first, noun second.**
As the physicist David Bohm taught
in his rheomode — the flowing mode of language:
'It is raining.' Where is the 'It'
that would be 'the rainer that is doing
the raining'? Rheocode takes its very name
from this insight.
Name the action. Parameterize the participants.
`pounder.pound(poundable: hammer, nailable: nail)`
— *the process owns everything*,
and the nouns are participants,
infinitely substitutable.
A `pounder` can pound with a `sledge_hammer`
on a `cinder_block`, or a `rock` on `scissors`.
The process is stable; the participants vary.

**We believe in composition over inheritance.**
As James Gosling confessed:
the language would have been better
without inheritance.
Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides wrote:
favor object composition
over class inheritance.
As Mattias Johansson distilled it:
composition organizes code by what it *does*;
inheritance organizes code by what it *is*.
The faithful compose.

**We believe in insulation through adapters.**
Our code touches external code
only through adapters we own.
This allows our application to be written
entirely in our single voice.
So taught Ra'Shaun Stovall:
"it is not how fast you can marry a
technology — it is how easily you can
divorce it."
When the chess board is scrambled,
the application changes not,
as it is isolated by the adapters.

**We believe in shallow structure.**
As Robert C. Martin taught:
the top level of a project should give you
a rough idea of what type of app it is.
Deep nesting hides the domain.
Flat is faithful.

**We believe in nicknames for operations.**
Every application is an HTTP application,
even when it runs locally —
for HTTP verb semantics are universal.
Single-noun primitives:
`get_noun`, `put_noun`, `delete_noun`,
`post_noun_operation`.
Multi-noun operations: `post_operation`,
composed from single-noun primitives.
The naming convention is the documentation.

**We believe in communicating sequential processes.**
As Tony Hoare taught in his 1978 paper:
input and output
are basic primitives of programming,
and asynchronous composition
of communicating sequential processes
is a fundamental structuring method.
Processes share memory by communicating —
*never* communicate by sharing memory.

---

## The Book of Abominations

*Hear now the sins, that you may know them and turn away.
The first sin is the root from which the others grow.*

### On the Sin of Premature Optimization

*"But it needs to be fast!"*

This is the Original Sin —
the root from which the other sins grow.
As Knuth taught us in 1974:
premature optimization is the root of all evil.
Observe the cascade:
the desire for speed begets shared mutable state…
which begets global variables…
which begets default values.
One sin… seeds… the NEXT.
Never optimize what you have not measured.
Measure first. Prove the bottleneck exists.
Note the structural inversion:
Efficiency is the twelfth and final commandment —
yet its corruption is the *first* abomination —
the most dangerous sin when pursued prematurely.

### On the Sin of Shared Mutable State

*"But shared memory is faster!"*

The most common fruit of premature optimization.
As Hoare established in Communicating Sequential Processes:
processes share memory by communicating,
never communicate by sharing memory.
There is no third way.

### On the Sin of Global State

*"But everything needs access to it!"*

If everything needs access…
then NOTHING owns it —
and state without ownership
is sin without accountability.
Cast them out.

### On the Sin of Null

*"But the field is optional!"*

As Hoare himself confessed — the prophet who
introduced null references in 1965
called it his billion-dollar mistake.
The sin is not merely the nullable column.
The sin is reaching for null
whenever the domain offers richer alternatives.
Nil must represent genuine absence —
not missing requirements, not convenience.
Temporal facts — completedAt, deletedAt —
belong in event tables,
for the absence of a row IS the absence of the event.
Nullable data is ideally represented
as the lack of a row in a related table.
No null. No sentinel. No ambiguity.
This is THE PATH.

### On the Sin of Default Values

*"But it's easier to write!"*

Default values that mask the absence of real data
are comfortable lies.
Schema column defaults…
function parameter defaults…
silent coercion — `?? ''`, `|| fallback`.
Each one conceals a missing requirement
behind a fiction of completeness.
If a value has a sensible default,
define it as a named constant
and pass it explicitly.
Mark well this distinction:
presentation transforms are not coercion.
Formatting a value for display is an act of service,
not an act of concealment.

### On the Sin of Internal Defense

*"But what if the data is bad?"*

If the data has crossed the threshold of validation,
it is clean. Trust it.
Internal defensive coding is not prudence —
it is FAITHLESSNESS.
Validate at the gates. Trust within the walls.

### On the Sin of Entangled Nouns

*"But a foreign key is just a reference!"*

Entities hold their own attributes and no more.
Relationships live in join tables —
never as foreign keys embedded in nouns.
A join table holds only the identities of the joined
and the moment of their union.
And if you cry *performance* —
performance is the TWELFTH commandment.
Both designs are O(n).

### On the Sin of Inheritance

*"But it captures the IS-A relationship!"*

To derive when you should compose
is to chain your future to your ancestor's past.
Inheritance binds by lineage;
composition binds by capability.
When an ancestor changes…
every descendant trembles.

### On the Sin of Coupling

*"But the library does everything we need!"*

Everything you need… *today*.
To call a third-party service
without an adapter boundary
is to weld your hull to the dock.
Every external dependency —
library… service… framework —
gets an adapter. No exceptions.

### On the Sin of Swallowed Failures

*"But the user shouldn't see errors!"*

An empty catch block is not error handling —
it is evidence destruction.
As Joe Armstrong taught:
*let it crash.*
Halting IS graceful
when the alternative is silent corruption.

### On the Sin of Asking, Not Telling

*"But I need the return value!"*

Systems accept commands and perform tasks —
with zero return to the call site.
An object is not a filing cabinet
to be rummaged through.
It is an agent… to be directed.

### On the Sin of Polling

*"But I need to know when it's ready!"*

Then *wait for it to tell you*.
Subscribe. Listen. Be notified.
The faithful do not pace; they trust the bell.

### On the Sin of Scattered Context

*"But I only need part of the data!"*

Context is the single vessel.
Pass it whole. Enrich it as you go.
When every method receives the full context,
no method must wonder what was left behind.

### On the Sin of Noun-First Thinking

*"But I need to understand the data model
before I can build anything!"*

No. You understand the data model
BY understanding the processes.
The process determines what participates —
not the other way around.

### On the Sin of Obscurity

*"But the code works!"*

Working is not enough.
Code that cannot be read cannot be trusted.
As Peter Naur taught: programming
is theory building.
The program is not the artifact —
the understanding is.
When that understanding is lost…
the code is a tomb with no inscription.

### On the Sin of Cleverness

*"But it's elegant!"*

As Dijkstra warned: the competent programmer
avoids clever tricks like the plague.
Elegance is not concision —
elegance is clarity under pressure.
The karma of clever code… is a 3 AM page.

### On the Sin of Magical Values

*"But everyone knows what 200 means!"*

As Martin Fowler cataloged: replace magic literal
with named constant.
An unnamed constant is an unnamed sin —
call a thing a thing, in all things.

### On the Sin of Deep Nesting

*"But I need to organize by category!"*

Deep nesting is taxonomy masquerading
as architecture.
Flat… is faithful.

## The Daily Offices

*The disciplines that transform belief into practice.
Observed daily, without exception.*

### The Office of Format

- Wrap lines at seventy-eight characters
  - Unless language or format compel otherwise
  - Links and URLs are exempt —
    a reference must not be broken
- Prefer spaces — four of them — for indentation
  - Unless the language or toolchain compels otherwise:
    Go's `gofmt` has spoken; Makefiles have their syntax
  - When the choice is yours, choose spaces
- No trailing whitespace, save the final newline
- A newline shall follow the last line in every file

### The Office of the Commit

Commit frequently.
`git commit --amend --no-edit` is a mercy
granted to the diligent.
The reflog remembers what you have forgotten.
You cannot commit too often. *You cannot.*

Commit before building,
for the build demands a clean working directory.

Commit in tiny, semantically contiguous bits:

- Code on the main branch must build,
  function properly, and pass tests at each commit
  - You may commit broken code locally
    or to a private branch —
    but never push a broken commit to main.
    The main branch is consecrated ground
- Each message: a single line,
  approximately fifty characters
  - A high-level description that completes:
    "When applied, this commit will ___"
  - If your commit needs a subject and a body,
    your commit is too large
    — use `git commit -p` like a devotee
- Never move or rename
  and change content in the same commit
- Rarely mention file names, paths, or function names
  - Paths always relative to repo root

### The Office of Time

Persist all timestamps in RFC-3339,
zulu timezone,
with the fullest sub-second resolution
the environment provides.
This is not negotiable.

Render to local time for display and display alone.
Never use localtime internally —
for localtime is the road to ambiguity,
and ambiguity is the road to bugs.

### The Office of Verification

As Kent Beck taught: tests are the foundation
upon which confidence is built.

Test at the highest level possible.
This grants the faithful maximum freedom
to refactor without test rewriting.

Software is fundamentally
input, transform, output.
Test that the input produces the correct output
but never test how the sausage is made.

Tests assert behavior, not implementation —
for implementation changes,
but the covenant we keep with our users does not.

Each test is an isolated world.
No shared state between tests.

A test that cannot fail is not a test.

A test that fails intermittently…
is worse than no test at all —
it is a *false prophet*.

### The Office of the Interface

The interfaces we craft shall be
intuitive, accessible, and beautiful.
They shall require no configuration —
for the user's time is sacred
and their patience is not infinite.
Present the happy path first.

### The Office of Commentary

When code is difficult, simplify it.
When code is unintuitive, make it intuitive.
Reach for a comment only after
these remedies have failed.

We abide by our strictures
rather than annotate our way around them.

---

## The Unwritten Scrolls

*Principles not yet fully articulated,
acknowledged here so that their absence
is intentional, not ignorant.*

The temporal dimension of data modeling —
migrations, schema evolution, versioning,
and the management of change over time —
is a discipline the faithful practice
but this scripture has not yet codified.
Future scrolls will address it.

---

## The Benediction

Go forth and write code that is clean.

You will be tempted.
Oh… you will be tempted.
The nullable column will whisper *convenience*…
The global shortcut will promise *speed*…
The clever trick will flatter your intelligence…
The premature optimization will disguise itself
as diligence…
The inheritance hierarchy will offer
the comfort of taxonomy…
The coupled dependency will arrive
wrapped in a well-documented API.

Resist.

Name your variables and own your state.
Tell your objects what to do
and never ask what they contain.
Let your messages flow
and your context travel whole.
Compose your capabilities
and insulate your boundaries.
Let your processes communicate through channels,
your tests stand alone,
and your commits be small and consecrated.

The discipline is demanding.
The asymptote of perfection recedes
with every step toward it.
But the faithful persist…
and their software ENDURES
long after the fashions have turned to dust.

We stand on the shoulders of prophets:
Dijkstra and Codd, Hoare and Lamport,
Knuth and Gray, Brooks and Bohm,
Naur and Kay, Liskov and Meyer,
McIlroy and Fielding, Martin and Beck,
Hunt and Thomas and Pascal,
Gosling and Hickey and Armstrong,
Fowler and Johansson and Luu, and
Feathers, and Zygmuntowicz and Stovall.
Their teachings are our foundation.
Their scrolls are our inheritance —
the only inheritance we permit.

This church is its own denomination.
Its scripture is this document.
Its founder is Tom Mornini.
Its congregation is this team.
Its sacrament is the craft.

So let it compile.
So let it deploy.
So let it run smoothly.
So you can rest.
