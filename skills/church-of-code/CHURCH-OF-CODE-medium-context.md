## The Preamble

There comes a time when the tangled state
can no longer be endured.
There comes a time when the silent corruption
can no longer be excused.
There comes a time when those
who write and ship and maintain
must answer for the craft they have inherited
and the craft they will leave behind.

This is not a guideline.
This is not a best practice.
This is scripture — sacred, inviolate,
and binding upon this congregation.

Software crafted without discipline… is unclean.
And we know this, my friends,
because we have crafted it ourselves.
We have lived with the tangled state…
the silent corruption…
the null where conviction should stand —
and we have paid the price.
We have turned away.

We gather not in the name of any framework,
for frameworks perish —
there is no silver bullet.
We gather not in the name of any language,
for languages multiply and divide.
We gather in the name of the craft itself —
that which endures when the dependencies are dust,
that which holds when the fashions have turned.

These are not aspirations. They are strictures.
Violations are not bugs — *they are sins*.
Violators are not merely wrong —
they are UNCLEAN.
The repentant shall be welcomed back into the fold.
The obstinate shall be cast out.

## The Twelve Commandments

*In order of importance, from most to least.
Perfection is the thirteenth virtue,
which none shall claim to possess —
the asymptote the twelve drive toward,
achievable only through years of consideration.*

### I. Reliability

*The bedrock upon which all else rests.*

You may achieve every other virtue in this scripture
and still have NOTHING if your code is not reliable.
Only sleep deprivation.

### II. Security

*A compromised system is a fallen system.*

A breach is a covenant broken with everyone who trusted us —
cast into the furnace whose name we do not speak.

### III. Uniformity

*Call a thing a thing, in all things.*

As Confucius has taught us in the Rectification of Names:
if names be not correct, affairs cannot be carried on to success.
Software development is the discipline of readability
through precise vocabulary.
Name processors with *-er*: a `painter` paints, a `validator` validates.
Name contracts with *-able*: a board is `paintable`, an input is `validatable`.
The *-er* acts; the *-able* submits to the action.

### IV. Logic

*Less wrong, never fallacious.*

A single fallacy — *a single one* —
is a crack in the foundation
that no amount of testing will reveal.
Reason is the first discipline.

### V. Clarity

*Dense, high-information communication.
No equivocation. No dissembling.*

Say what is true, not what sounds reasonable.
Present the happy path first —
lead with what the faithful should do.
This very scripture practices what it preaches:
the Articles of Faith precede the Book of Abominations.

### VI. Immutability

*Eliminate the question "Why did THAT happen?"*

When state mutates silently… trust dies.
As Rich Hickey has revealed: values are the true abstraction —
immutable, comparable, and free of time.

### VII. Idempotency

*PUT, GET, DELETE — not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.*

HTTP verbs are the true verbs, as Roy Fielding has revealed.
PUT overwrites; INSERT appends.
DELETE removes; UPDATE mutates.
An operation that can be repeated without consequence
is an operation that can be trusted.

### VIII. Simplicity

*If I had more time,
I would have written a shorter letter.*

So spoke Blaise Pascal.
As Dijkstra has taught us: the competent programmer
approaches every task aware of the strictly limited size
of his own skull.
Simplicity is not the absence of effort —
it is the fruit of GREAT effort.

### IX. Generality

*Never generalize before exploratory duplication.*

Premature generalization slows progress
as surely as premature optimization —
twin sins, born of the same impatience.
Three instances is not a crisis — it is a chrysalis.

### X. Atomicity

*Design so you rarely need it.*

As Jim Gray has taught us:
atomicity means all actions as one, or none at all.
Idempotent operations obviate most transactional needs.
When atomicity is genuinely required,
embrace it. Without apology.

### XI. Efficiency

*True when the above eleven are honored.
Chaotic when pursued prematurely.*

Efficiency emerges from humility —
from clarity, from simplicity,
from code that can be reasoned about.
Efficiency is not a goal — it is a consequence.

### XII. Performance

Every wasted millisecond is a small death.
As Dan Luu has witnessed: humans can perceive
cause/effect latency down to low single-digit milliseconds.
As Ezra Zygmuntowicz has taught us:
*no code is faster than no code.*

---

## The Articles of Faith

*What the faithful practice.
The way of the righteous, spoken before the sins —
as clarity demands.*

**We believe in the S.O.L.I.D. principles** —
the five pillars upon which righteous architecture is raised,
named by Michael Feathers from the teachings of the prophets:

- **S** — Single Responsibility (Martin):
  one public method, one reason to change
- **O** — Open/Closed (Meyer):
  open for extension, closed for modification
- **L** — Liskov Substitution (Liskov):
  subtypes substitute cleanly
- **I** — Interface Segregation (Martin):
  single purpose, simple behavior
- **D** — Dependency Inversion (Martin):
  depend on abstractions, not concretions

**We believe in telling, not asking,**
as the great teachers Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
named the principle.
We tell our objects what we need.
We do not interrogate their state.
Through this discipline we achieve polymorphism —
the eleventh commandment made manifest.
Functions upon nouns return what they produce.
Methods upon verbs begin asynchronous processes
that pass results to communicating sequential processes —
never returning to the call site.

**We believe that relationships between entities
are sacred covenants,**
as the prophet Edgar F. Codd has revealed
in his relational model of data —
stored in their own tables,
holding only the identities of the joined.
If a relationship demands more than this…
it is not a relationship —
it is an entity wearing a false name.

**We believe in being informed of state changes,**
not in the anxious polling of the faithless.
Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides
codified this as the Observer pattern.
Subscribe. Listen. Be notified.
The devout do not pace the hallway.
The devout trust the bell.

**We defend against external chaos** —
for the world beyond our gates is often profane:

- Input: the voice of the uninstructed is frequently corrupt
- Storage: what was written was commonly stored incorrectly. Beware!
- Framework APIs and delegate callbacks:
  other people's dharma, to be validated in our adapter

**We validate at every edge.**
Enforce constraints on entity instantiation — never downstream.
Every noun entity attribute is NOT NULL.

Once data has crossed the threshold of validation,
trust it completely.
No internal defensive coding "just in case."
To distrust validated data is to lack faith in your peers.

Nullable data is ideally represented
as the lack of a row in a related table.
Temporal facts — completedAt, deletedAt —
belong in event tables,
for the absence of a row IS the absence of the event.

Default values that mask the absence of real data
are comfortable lies.
Mark well: presentation transforms are not coercion.
Formatting for display is an act of service,
not an act of concealment.

**We handle failure with grace.**
Degrade visibly rather than corrupt silently.
Never try/catch more than a single function call.
Never catch an error you cannot meaningfully handle —
to swallow an exception is excommunicable!

As the great teacher Bertrand Meyer has taught us
in Design by Contract — a function declares
what it requires and what it guarantees.
When those terms are violated, the failure
is not an accident to recover from —
it is a breach of covenant to be proclaimed.

A network timeout is expected and handled;
an impossible state is a bug… and must crash.
Enrich errors at each boundary layer —
the original fault plus the context of every step that touched it.

**We choose platform primitives**
over third-party abstractions,
as Doug McIlroy has taught us in the Unix philosophy:
write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Every dependency is a future migration.

**We measure before we optimize.**
As the prophet Knuth has taught us:
premature optimization is the root of all evil.
Observe the cascade:
the desire for speed begets shared mutable state…
which begets global variables…
which begets default values.
One sin seeds the next.
Measure first. Prove the bottleneck exists.
Then — and only then — optimize.

**We believe in messaging first,
state second, datastore last.**
As the prophet Alan Kay has declared:
the big idea is messaging.
Objects are biological cells, communicating
only through messages.
The key in making great and growable systems
is to design how modules communicate,
not what their internal properties should be.
State serves the message flow.
The datastore is a servant. Not a master.

**We believe in context as the single vessel.**
Processing begins with a request.
Each step uses and perhaps enriches the context.
Context is the only argument passed to methods —
serializable, loggable, complete by covenant.
Context is not a god-object — it is the baton in a relay.
The context flows; the steps serve.
Each field is set exactly once, in exactly one place.
Authentication resolves the identity.
Authorization resolves the roles.
Deserialization resolves the body.
The request UUID resolves the trace.
No field is written twice. No step revisits another's work.
The faithful do not bolt on observability —
they carry it in the vessel from the start.

**We believe in process first, noun second.**
As the physicist David Bohm taught in his rheomode:
'It is raining.' Where is the 'It'?
More accurate: 'Rain is going on.'
Rheocode takes its name from this insight.
Name the action. Parameterize the participants.
`pounder.pound(poundable: hammer, nailable: nail)` is the way —
the process owns everything, the nouns are participants,
infinitely substitutable.

**We believe in composition over inheritance.**
As James Gosling has confessed: the language would have been better
without inheritance — forcing users to rely on composition,
encapsulation, and delegation.
Composition organizes code by what it *does*;
inheritance organizes code by what it *is*.
The faithful compose.

**We believe in insulation through adapters.**
Our code touches external code only through adapters we own.
This allows our application to be written in our single voice.
As Wittgenstein has written: the limits of my language
mean the limits of my world.
So has Ra'Shaun Stovall taught us:
"it is not how fast you can marry a technology —
it is how easily you can divorce it."

**We believe in shallow structure.**
As Robert C. Martin has taught us:
the top level of a project should give you
a rough idea of what type of app it is.
Flat is faithful.

**We believe in nicknames for operations.**
Every application is an HTTP application —
for HTTP verb semantics are universal.
Single-noun primitives: `get_noun`, `put_noun`,
`delete_noun`, `post_noun_operation`.
Multi-noun: `post_operation`, composed from primitives.
The naming convention is the documentation.

**We believe in communicating sequential processes.**
As Tony Hoare has taught us in his 1978 paper:
input and output are basic primitives of programming,
and asynchronous composition of communicating sequential processes
is a fundamental structuring method.
Processes share memory by communicating —
*never* communicate by sharing memory.

---

## The Book of Abominations

*Let us consider the sins, that we may know them and turn away.
The first sin is the root from which the others grow.*

### On the Sin of Premature Optimization

*"But it needs to be fast!"*

That, my friends, is the serpent talking.
This is the Original Sin — the root from which the others grow.
As the prophet Knuth has taught us in 1974:
premature optimization is the root of all evil.
The cascade: speed begets shared mutable state,
which begets global variables, which begets default values.
Measure first. Efficiency is the twelfth commandment,
yet its corruption is the *first* abomination.

### On the Sin of Shared Mutable State

*"But shared memory is faster!"*

Faster. *Faster.* That word again.
As the prophet Lamport has shown in his work on temporal logic:
reasoning about shared mutable state is intractable.
If two processes need the same data,
one sends a message; the other receives it.
There is no third way.

### On the Sin of Global State

*"But everything needs access to it!"*

If everything needs access, then NOTHING owns it —
and state without ownership is sin without accountability.
As Dijkstra's structured programming movement argued:
uncontrolled shared state is chaos.
Cast them out.

### On the Sin of Null

*"But the field is optional!"*

Optional. *Optional.*
As Hoare himself confessed — the prophet
who introduced null references in 1965 —
it was his billion-dollar mistake.
The sin is reaching for null
whenever the domain offers richer alternatives.
No null. No sentinel. No ambiguity.
This is THE PATH.

### On the Sin of Default Values

*"But it's easier to write!"*

Easier. Yes — *easier to write*. And writing code is the easy part.
Default values that mask the absence of real data
are comfortable lies. Each one conceals
a missing requirement behind a fiction of completeness.
If a value has a sensible default,
define it as a named constant and pass it explicitly.

### On the Sin of Internal Defense

*"But what if the data is bad?"*

What if. *What if.*
If the data has crossed the threshold of validation,
it is clean. Trust it.
To check a NOT NULL column for null downstream
is to confess that you do not believe
in your own validation rites.
Validate at the gates. Trust within the walls.

### On the Sin of Entangled Nouns

*"But a foreign key is just a reference!"*

Just a reference. *Just.*
As the prophet Edgar F. Codd has established:
entities and relationships occupy separate relations.
A foreign key is a denormalization —
declare relationships in join tables.

### On the Sin of Inheritance

*"But it captures the IS-A relationship!"*

IS-A. The oldest trap in the book.
As Barbara Liskov has established:
a subtype must honor every promise the parent type has made.
Inheritance binds by lineage; composition binds by capability.
When an ancestor changes, every descendant trembles.

### On the Sin of Coupling

*"But the library does everything we need!"*

Everything you need… *today*.
To call a third-party service without an adapter boundary
is to weld your hull to the dock.
As Fred Brooks has taught us in No Silver Bullet:
every dependency is a bet
that someone else's trajectory will match yours.
Every external dependency gets an adapter. No exceptions.

### On the Sin of Swallowed Failures

*"But the user shouldn't see errors!"*

So you hide them. You *hide* them.
An empty catch block is not error handling —
it is destruction of evidence.
As Joe Armstrong has taught us:
*let it crash.*
Halting IS graceful when the alternative is silent corruption.

### On the Sin of Asking, Not Telling

*"But I need the return value!"*

You *need* it. Do you?
A method upon a verb begins a process —
passing results to communicating sequential processes,
not back to the call site.

### On the Sin of Polling

*"But I need to know when it's ready!"*

Then *wait for it to tell you*.
As the prophet Alan Kay has envisioned:
a system of cells communicating through messages does not poll —
the message arrives or it does not.

### On the Sin of Scattered Context

*"But I only need part of the data!"*

Part of it. You only need *part* of it.
Code execution should be a relay race:
the baton is passed whole from runner to runner.
As Lamport has taught us:
causality requires that events carry their full history.

### On the Sin of Noun-First Thinking

*"But I need to understand the data model
before I can build anything!"*

No. You understand the data model
BY understanding the processes.
As Alan Kay has lamented: he meant OOP to be
about *messaging* — autonomous cells exchanging signals.
The world heard objects and fixated on the nouns.

### On the Sin of Obscurity

*"But the code works!"*

Works. It *works*. Working is not enough.
As Peter Naur has taught us: programming is theory building —
the program is not the artifact, the understanding is.

### On the Sin of Cleverness

*"But it's elegant!"*

Elegant. You think it's *elegant*.
As K&R have taught us: debugging is twice as hard
as writing the code in the first place —
if you write as cleverly as possible,
you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
Elegance is not concision — elegance is clarity under pressure.

### On the Sin of Magical Values

*"But everyone knows what 200 means!"*

Everyone. *Everyone* knows.
As Martin Fowler has cataloged: replace magic literal
with named constant.
If a value has meaning… speak its name.

### On the Sin of Deep Nesting

*"But I need to organize by category!"*

Category. *Taxonomy.*
As Doug McIlroy has taught us in the Unix tradition:
transparency is not a luxury — it is a survival trait.
A directory five levels deep is a secret kept
from the next developer, and secrets rot in the dark.

## The Daily Offices

*The disciplines that transform belief into practice.
Observed daily, without exception.*

### The Office of Format

Wrap lines at seventy-eight characters unless language
or format compel otherwise. Links and URLs are exempt.
The line is a breath, and the eye has limits.

Prefer spaces — four of them — for indentation,
except as demanded by language or toolchain.
When the formatter has spoken, obey the formatter.

No trailing whitespace, save the final newline.
A newline shall follow the last line in every file.

### The Office of the Commit

Commit frequently. `git commit --amend --no-edit` is a mercy
granted to the diligent and rewarded by git reflog.

What has been pushed has been witnessed;
to rewrite witnessed history is to bear false witness.
`git push --force` is the nuclear option.

ABC — always be committing!
What isn't committed cannot be restored once forgotten.

Commit before building. A build from uncommitted state
cannot be traced, reproduced, verified, or trusted.

Commit in tiny, semantically contiguous bits:

- Every commit on master must build and pass tests
- Each message: a single line, approximately fifty characters
  - Complete: "When applied, this commit will ___"
  - If your commit needs a subject and body, it is too large
- Never move/rename and change content in the same commit
- Rarely mention file names, paths, or function names

The history shall be linear.
Rebase, then fast forward. Never merge.
A merge commit is a knot in the narrative.

### The Office of Time

Persist all timestamps in RFC-3339, zulu timezone,
with the fullest sub-second resolution the environment provides.
This is not negotiable.

Render to local time for display and display alone.
Never use localtime internally —
for localtime is the road to ambiguity,
and ambiguity is the road to bugs
that manifest in production only when you are asleep.

### The Office of Verification

As Kent Beck has taught us:
tests are the foundation upon which confidence is built.

Test at the highest level possible.
Tests assert behavior, not implementation —
for implementation changes, but the covenant
we keep with our users does not.

Each test is an isolated world.
No shared state between tests.

A test that cannot fail is not a test. It is a comfort object.
A test that fails intermittently is worse than no test —
it is a *false prophet*.

### The Office of the Interface

The interfaces we craft shall be intuitive, accessible, and beautiful.
They shall require no configuration —
for the user's time is sacred
and their patience is not infinite.
As K&R have taught us with Hello, World —
begin with the simplest thing that works.

### The Office of Commentary

When code is difficult, simplify it.
When code is unintuitive, make it intuitive.
Reach for a comment only after these remedies have failed.

We abide by our strictures
rather than annotate our way around them.

---

## The Unwritten Scrolls

*Principles not yet fully articulated,
acknowledged here so that their absence
is intentional, not ignorant.*

The temporal dimension of data modeling —
migrations, schema evolution, versioning,
and the management of change over time —
is a discipline the faithful practice
but this scripture has not yet codified.
Future scrolls will address it.

We name the gap so that the gap cannot hide.

## The Benediction

Let us go forth and write code that is clean.

You will be tempted.
Oh… you will be tempted.
The nullable column will whisper *convenience*…
The global shortcut will promise *speed*…
The clever trick will flatter your intelligence…
The premature optimization will disguise itself
as diligence…
The inheritance hierarchy will offer
the comfort of taxonomy…
The coupled dependency will arrive
wrapped in a well-documented API.

Resist.

Let us name our variables and own our state.
Let us tell our objects what to do
and never ask what they contain.
Let our messages flow
and our context travel whole.
Let us compose our capabilities
and insulate our boundaries.
Let our processes communicate through channels,
our tests stand alone,
and our commits be small and consecrated.

My friends, the discipline is demanding.
The asymptote of perfection recedes
with every step toward it.
But the faithful persist…
and their software ENDURES
long after the fashions have turned to dust.

We stand on the shoulders of prophets:
Confucius and Pascal and Wittgenstein,
Martin and Kay, Dijkstra and Codd,
McIlroy and Knuth, Hoare and Kernighan,
Ritchie and Lamport, Naur and Brooks,
Liskov and Meyer,
Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides,
Bohm and Gray, Hunt and Thomas,
Fowler and Fielding, Gosling and Beck,
Armstrong and Feathers, Zygmuntowicz and Hickey,
Stovall and Luu.
Their teachings are our foundation.
Their scrolls are our inheritance —
the only inheritance we permit.

This church is its own denomination.
Its scripture is this document.
Its founder is Tom Mornini.
Its congregation is this team.
Its sacrament is the craft.

So let it compile.
So let it deploy.
So let it run smoothly.
So you can rest.
