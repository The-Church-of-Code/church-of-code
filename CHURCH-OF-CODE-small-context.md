# The Church of Code

*v1.9 — small*

## The Preamble

There comes a time when the tangled state
can no longer be endured,
the silent corruption no longer excused,
the null where conviction should stand no longer tolerated.

This is scripture — sacred, inviolate,
and binding upon this congregation.

Software crafted without discipline is unclean.
We have crafted it ourselves, and we have paid the price.

These are not aspirations. They are strictures.
Violations are not bugs — *they are sins*.
Violators are not merely wrong — they are UNCLEAN.

## The Twelve Commandments

*Ranked virtues, from most to least important.
Perfection is the asymptote the twelve drive toward.*

### I. Reliability
*The bedrock upon which all else rests.*

### II. Security
*A compromised system is a fallen system.*

### III. Uniformity
*Call a thing a thing, in all things.*
Software development is the discipline of readability
through precise vocabulary.
Name processors with *-er*; name contracts with *-able*.
The *-er* acts; the *-able* submits to the action.

### IV. Logic
*Less wrong, never fallacious.*

### V. Clarity
*Dense, high-information communication.
No equivocation. No dissembling.*

### VI. Immutability
*Eliminate the question "Why did THAT happen?"*
As Hickey has taught us: values are the true abstraction —
immutable, comparable, and free of time.

### VII. Idempotency
*PUT, GET, DELETE — not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.*
HTTP verbs are the true verbs, as Fielding revealed.
PUT overwrites; INSERT appends. DELETE removes; UPDATE mutates.

### VIII. Simplicity
*If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.*
So spoke Pascal. As Dijkstra taught: approach every task
aware of the strictly limited size of your own skull.
Simplicity is not the absence of effort —
it is the fruit of GREAT effort.

### IX. Generality
*Never generalize before exploratory duplication.*
Three instances is not a crisis — it is a chrysalis.

### X. Atomicity
*Design so you rarely need it.*
As Gray taught: all actions as one, or none at all.
Idempotent operations obviate most transactional needs.

### XI. Efficiency
*True when the above eleven are honored.*
Efficiency is not a goal — it is a consequence.

### XII. Performance
Every wasted millisecond is a small death.
As Luu has witnessed: humans perceive latency
down to low single-digit milliseconds.
As Zygmuntowicz taught: *no code is faster than no code.*

## The Articles of Faith

**We believe in the S.O.L.I.D. principles** —
Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution,
Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
Named by Feathers from the teachings of Martin, Meyer, and Liskov.
The five pillars upon which righteous architecture is raised.

**We believe in telling, not asking,**
as Hunt and Thomas named the principle.
We tell our objects what we need; we do not interrogate their state.
Functions upon nouns return what they produce.
Methods upon verbs begin processes that pass results
to communicating sequential processes — never to the call site.

**We believe that relationships between entities are sacred covenants,**
as Codd revealed in his relational model.
Entities and relationships occupy separate relations.
Declare relationships in join tables.
If a relationship demands more than this,
it is an entity wearing a false name.

**We believe in being informed of state changes,**
not in the anxious polling of the faithless.
Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides codified this as the Observer pattern.
Subscribe. Listen. Be notified.
The devout do not pace the hallway; they trust the bell.

**We defend against external chaos** —
for the world beyond our gates is often profane.
Input is frequently corrupt.
Storage was commonly stored incorrectly.
Framework APIs and callbacks are validated only in our adapter.

**We validate at every edge.**
Enforce constraints on entity instantiation — never downstream.
Every noun entity attribute is NOT NULL.
Once data has crossed the threshold of validation, trust it completely.
No internal defensive coding "just in case."
Nullable data is ideally the lack of a row in a related table.
Temporal facts — completedAt, deletedAt — belong in event tables.
Default values that mask missing data are comfortable lies.
Presentation transforms are not coercion —
formatting for display is an act of service, not concealment.

**We handle failure with grace.**
Degrade visibly rather than corrupt silently.
Never try/catch more than a single function call.
Never catch an error you cannot meaningfully handle —
to swallow an exception is excommunicable.
As Meyer taught in Design by Contract: when terms are violated,
the failure is a breach of covenant to be proclaimed.
A network timeout is expected and handled;
an impossible state is a bug — *let it crash*.

**We choose platform primitives** over third-party abstractions,
as McIlroy taught in the Unix philosophy:
write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Every dependency is a future migration.

**We measure before we optimize.**
As Knuth taught: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
The cascade: the desire for speed begets shared mutable state,
which begets global variables, which begets default values.
One sin seeds the next.
Measure first. Prove the bottleneck exists.

**We believe in messaging first, state second, datastore last.**
As Kay declared: the big idea is messaging.
Objects are biological cells, communicating only through messages.
Design how modules communicate,
not what their internal properties should be.
The datastore is a servant. Not a master.

**We believe in context as the single vessel.**
Processing begins with a request; each step enriches the context.
Context is the only argument passed to methods —
serializable, loggable, complete by covenant.
Context is not a god-object — it is the baton in a relay,
set exactly once, never revisited.
Authentication resolves identity; authorization resolves roles;
deserialization resolves body; the request UUID resolves the trace.
The faithful carry observability in the vessel from the start.

**We believe in process first, noun second.**
As Bohm taught in his rheomode: 'Rain is going on.'
Rheocode takes its name from this insight.
Name the action. Parameterize the participants.
`pounder.pound(poundable: hammer, nailable: nail)` is the way —
the process owns everything, the nouns are participants.

**We believe in composition over inheritance.**
As Gosling confessed: the language would have been better
without inheritance — forcing users to rely on composition,
encapsulation, and delegation.
Composition organizes code by what it *does*;
inheritance by what it *is*. The faithful compose.

**We believe in insulation through adapters.**
Our code touches external code only through adapters we own.
This allows our application to be written in our single voice.
As Wittgenstein wrote: the limits of my language
mean the limits of my world.
As Stovall taught: it is not how fast you can marry a technology —
it is how easily you can divorce it.

**We believe in shallow structure.**
As Martin taught: the top level of a project should give you
a rough idea of what type of app it is.
Deep nesting hides the domain. Flat is faithful.

**We believe in nicknames for operations.**
Every application is an HTTP application.
Single-noun primitives: `get_noun`, `put_noun`,
`delete_noun`, `post_noun_operation`.
Multi-noun operations compose from single-noun primitives.
The naming convention is the documentation.

**We believe in communicating sequential processes.**
As Hoare taught in his 1978 paper:
asynchronous composition of communicating sequential processes
is a fundamental structuring method.
Processes share memory by communicating —
*never* communicate by sharing memory.

## The Daily Offices

### The Office of Format
Wrap lines at seventy-eight characters
unless language or format compel otherwise.
Prefer spaces — four of them — for indentation,
except as demanded by language or toolchain.
When the formatter has spoken, obey the formatter.
No trailing whitespace. A newline shall follow
the last line in every file.

### The Office of the Commit
Commit frequently. ABC — always be committing.
What has been pushed has been witnessed;
to rewrite witnessed history is to bear false witness.
Commit before building — a build from uncommitted state
cannot be traced, reproduced, verified, or trusted.
Each commit on master must build and pass tests.
Each message: a single line, approximately fifty characters.
If your commit needs a subject and a body, it is too large.
Never move/rename and change content in the same commit.
History shall be linear. Rebase, then fast-forward. Never merge.

### The Office of Time
Persist all timestamps in RFC-3339, zulu timezone,
with the fullest sub-second resolution the environment provides.
This is not negotiable.
Render to local time for display and display alone.
Never use localtime internally.

### The Office of Verification
As Beck taught: tests are the foundation of confidence.
Test at the highest level possible.
Tests assert behavior, not implementation —
for implementation changes,
but the covenant we keep with our users does not.
Each test is an isolated world. No shared state between tests.
A test that cannot fail is not a test — it is a comfort object.
A test that fails intermittently is worse than no test —
it is a *false prophet*.

### The Office of the Interface
The interfaces we craft shall be intuitive, accessible, and beautiful.
They shall require no configuration —
for the user's time is sacred and their patience is not infinite.
Begin with the simplest thing that works.

### The Office of Commentary
When code is difficult, simplify it.
When code is unintuitive, make it intuitive.
Reach for a comment only after these remedies have failed.
We abide by our strictures
rather than annotate our way around them.

## The Unwritten Scrolls

*Principles not yet fully articulated,
acknowledged here so that their absence
is intentional, not ignorant.*

The temporal dimension of data modeling —
migrations, schema evolution, versioning,
and the management of change over time —
is a discipline the faithful practice
but this scripture has not yet codified.
Future scrolls will address it.

We name the gap so that the gap cannot hide.

gathered by Tom Mornini from the teachings
of the prophets who came before.*

## The Benediction

Let us go forth and write code that is clean.

You will be tempted. Resist.

Let us name our variables and own our state.
Let us tell our objects what to do and never ask what they contain.
Let our messages flow and our context travel whole.
Let us compose our capabilities and insulate our boundaries.
Let our processes communicate through channels,
our tests stand alone, and our commits be small and consecrated.

My friends, the discipline is demanding.
The asymptote of perfection recedes with every step toward it.
But the faithful persist, and their software ENDURES
long after the fashions have turned to dust.

This church is its own denomination.
Its scripture is this document.
Its founder is Tom Mornini.
Its congregation is this team.
Its sacrament is the craft.

So let it compile.
So let it deploy.
So let it run smoothly.
So you can rest.
