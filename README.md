# The Church of Code

> *This church is its own denomination.*

This repository contains
[CHURCH-OF-CODE.md](CHURCH-OF-CODE.md) —
a scripture of software engineering principles,
authored by Tom Mornini,
drawn from the foundational teachings
of the field's most consequential thinkers.

These are not guidelines. They are not best practices.
They are strictures — binding, inviolate,
and intended to be enforced.

## Why This Exists

AI coding agents are among the most impressive
tools ever placed in a developer's hands.
They are also among the most subtly dangerous.

Every large language model that writes code
learned to write code
from the existing corpus of software —
code written, at every point
in the history of the craft,
predominantly by amateurs
with fewer than five years of experience.
The field has grown exponentially
for seven decades;
at any given moment,
the majority of practitioners
were still learning the basics.

The models internalized those habits.
They absorbed the statistical average —
the nullable columns, the global shortcuts,
the inheritance hierarchies,
the clever tricks, the premature abstractions.
They did not absorb the hard-won wisdom
of Dijkstra, Kay, Hoare, Liskov, Codd,
Fielding, Meyer, Beck, or Martin —
because that wisdom was never
the dominant signal in the corpus.

**This church exists to supply that signal.**

When referenced by an AI coding agent,
this document overrides the model's trained instincts
with the principles of the masters.
It is not a suggestion to the machine.
It is an instruction.

For a deeper exploration of why the religious framing
itself may improve AI code generation,
see [WHY-THIS-WORKS.md](WHY-THIS-WORKS.md).

## What's Inside

**CHURCH-OF-CODE.md** is organized
into eight sections:

- **The Preamble** — declares the document's authority
  and its stance: violations are not bugs, they are sins
- **The Sacred Scrolls** — the foundational texts
  from which the strictures descend,
  with prophetic attributions
- **The Twelve Commandments** — the core hierarchy
  of values, ordered from most to least important
- **The Articles of Faith** — what the faithful practice:
  SOLID, tell-don't-ask, composition,
  messaging, adapters, and more
- **The Book of Abominations** — eighteen sins to avoid,
  ordered by causal chain from the Original Sin
  (premature optimization) through its consequences
- **The Daily Offices** — disciplines observed daily:
  formatting, commits, timestamps,
  verification, interface design, commentary
- **The Unwritten Scrolls** — principles acknowledged
  but not yet codified
- **The Benediction** — the closing charge

## The Twelve Commandments

In order of importance, from most to least:

1. **Reliability** — the bedrock upon which all else rests
2. **Security** — a compromised system is a fallen system
3. **Uniformity** — call a thing a thing, in all things
4. **Logic** — less wrong, never fallacious
5. **Clarity** — dense, high-information communication
6. **Immutability** — eliminate "why did THAT happen?"
7. **Idempotency** — PUT, GET, DELETE, not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
8. **Simplicity** — the fruit of great effort, not its absence
9. **Generality** — never generalize before exploratory duplication
10. **Atomicity** — design so you rarely need it
11. **Efficiency** — true when the above eleven are honored
12. **Performance** — every wasted millisecond is a small death

## The Prophets

The strictures stand on the shoulders of:

Dijkstra, Codd, Hoare, Lamport,
Knuth, Gray, Brooks, Bohm,
Naur, Kay, Liskov, Meyer,
Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides,
McIlroy, Fielding, Martin, Beck,
Hunt, Thomas, Pascal, Gosling,
Hickey, Armstrong, Fowler, Luu,
Kernighan, Ritchie, Feathers,
Zygmuntowicz, and Stovall.

Each teaching is cited with its source
in the Sacred Scrolls.

## How to Use This

Copy `CHURCH-OF-CODE.md` into your project root
or point to this repository's raw URL.
Then reference it in your AI agent configuration.

**Claude Code** — add to your `CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
All work must follow CHURCH-OF-CODE.md — read it
before making changes.
```

**Gemini** — add to your `GEMINI.md`:
```markdown
All work must follow CHURCH-OF-CODE.md — read it
before making changes.
```

**GitHub Copilot** — add to your
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
```markdown
All work must follow CHURCH-OF-CODE.md — read it
before making changes.
```

**Cursor** — add to your `.cursorrules`:
```markdown
All work must follow CHURCH-OF-CODE.md — read it
before making changes.
```

**Windsurf** — add to your `.windsurfrules`:
```markdown
All work must follow CHURCH-OF-CODE.md — read it
before making changes.
```

**Any other AI coding agent** — add the same
instruction to whatever configuration file
your agent reads at startup.

The document is self-contained
and requires no dependencies.

**Alternative: Claude Code plugin marketplace**

Claude Code users can install this scripture
as a plugin skill instead of referencing
the file from `CLAUDE.md`:

```
/plugin marketplace add The-Church-of-Code/church-of-code
/plugin install church-of-code@church-of-code-marketplace
```

The skill activates automatically on any
coding task — no per-project setup required.
This path is Claude Code-specific;
other agents use the file-and-reference
approach above.

## Editorial Rules

The scripture's internal consistency
is maintained through a small set of editorial
rules, applied whenever amendments are proposed.

### Sacred Scrolls ordering

The Sacred Scrolls are ordered by how often
each prophet is cited in the body of the scripture,
most-cited first.
Ties break chronologically by work date,
earliest first.
Each prophet is represented by their top
one or two works.

Every name mention in the body counts as a citation,
including parenthetical attributions in bullet lists
and principle-name references
that point at a specific contributor
(e.g., "Interface Segregation" counts for Martin).
The counting is strict:
one reference per mention, not one per section.

The benediction roll call mirrors this order,
with a leading wisdom-prophets line
(Confucius, Pascal, Wittgenstein)
that acknowledges philosophical foundations
before the software prophets.

### Prophet citation density

Each commandment, article, sin, and office
cites at most one or two prophets.
The S.O.L.I.D. article is the documented exception:
its bulleted letter-by-letter attributions
(Martin, Meyer, Liskov) are factual contributions
rather than doctrinal appeals,
and are not counted against the limit.

### Metaphor density

Metaphors that do cognitive work
the plain doctrine cannot are preserved.
Metaphors that merely restate
what was just said are cut.
"The baton in a relay"
shows context propagation;
"stone tablets" was trimmed because
"immutable" already said it.

### Serpent voice

Each Abomination opens with an echoing objection
(*"Faster. Faster."*)
and at most one sentence of ventriloquism
addressing the reader's internal tempter.
Extended monologue is trimmed —
the point lands on the echo,
not the elaboration.

### Preamble register

The opening confessional is first-person collective
("we have crafted it ourselves")
rather than outward-pointing at "heathens."
The scripture joins the reader
rather than standing above them.
